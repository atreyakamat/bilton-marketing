## Tasks Remaining Outside the Repository
- **Technical foundations:** Run PageSpeed Insights/GTmetrix, compress current/future imagery to WebP (<100KB), enable asset caching (via CDN or hosting configuration), and ensure CSS/JS minification at build/deploy level.
- **Search Console coverage:** Generate & submit XML sitemap, verify robots.txt, and register the domain with Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
- **Core Web Vitals monitoring:** Configure ongoing LCP/INP/CLS tracking through Search Console, Lighthouse CI, or a service like Calibre.
- **Google Business Profile:** Claim, verify, and fully populate profiles for Bilton Marketing (Marketing Agency) and ColonyOne (Software Company); post weekly updates and activate review collection workflow.
- **Reviews & citations:** Launch NAP consistency checklist across directories (Justdial, Sulekha, IndiaMART), initiate client review outreach, and craft response templates using keyword-rich language.
- **Content production:** Execute the 12-week blog calendar, develop the two pillar guides, and commission case studies/original research assets to support link-building.
- **Link building:** Plan guest-post outreach (YourStory, Inc42, Social Samosa, Housing.com), list ColonyOne on SaaS directories (G2, Capterra, SoftwareSuggest, GetApp), and set Google Alerts for unlinked mentions.
- **Analytics stack:** Finalise GA4, Search Console, and optional heatmap tools; build KPI dashboards connecting social metrics with CRM/website data for monthly reporting.
- **Legal & branding assets:** Produce high-resolution logos and structured data-ready image assets, update favicon/manifest, and document brand voice guidelines for writers.
- **Team workflow:** Allocate budget per the recommended split (Content 40%, Technical 20%, Link Building 25%, Local SEO 10%, Analytics 5%) and establish a monthly SEO review cadence to evaluate progress against rankings and leads.
